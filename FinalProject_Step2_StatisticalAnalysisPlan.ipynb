    "To address the first aim, we intend to perform a one-way ANOVA to determine if there is an association between the type of cleft and speech performance scores. Cleft types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 correspond to cleft palate only, cleft lip only, unilateral cleft palate and lip, ilateral cleft palate and lip, and mixed sample respectively.  This test would allow us to determine if there is a difference between the means of the different cleft groups. We would visualize the results using a box plot to show the distribution of each group.\n",

    "To address the second aim, we intend to conduct a random effects meta regression of age of repair and mean difference of effect size, the hedges g value, between the control mean, standard deviation, and variance and sample mean, sample standard deviation, and sample variance to see if there is a difference in speech scores between different ages of subjects. The summary statistics will include mean, SD, and variance across different effect groups and effect sizes. The python packages we need will be pymare, statsmodels, and pythonmeta. We will visualize these results using forest plots, bubble plots, and tornado charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the third aim, we intend to do a Chi-squared test to understand the association between cleft type and location of subjects. We would like to understand if being born in the US has any relationship to having a cleft. We will visulaize  these results by using a bar plot to see the observed versus the expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the fourth aim, we intend to perform another one-way ANOVA to understand the differences in effect sizes for the different cleft and speech studies. The effect size measures how strong the relationship is between clefting and speech variables. Overall we expect similar effect size results, but some of the studies may have outlier results that would show issues with reproductibilty. We will visualize these results with a forest plot to see the mean and confidence intervals for each study."
